Program Use: 


There aren't any command line arguments when running the program. The main class
for the entry point of the program is the Controller class. This class handles
all of the interactions between the tuple space and the chat room.

The tuple space takes in tuples and stores them in a trie data structure
contained within a HashMap in the TupleSpace class.
