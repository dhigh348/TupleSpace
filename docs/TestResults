For the naive solution:
    after add: 40 ms
    after read: 28009 ms
    after remove: 29646 ms

For the final solution:
    after add: 106 ms
    after read: 2647 ms
    after remove: 2732 ms

Both tests ran with 100000 tuple add's initially. Then there were 10000 reads,
then there were 10000 removes, followed by 10000 adds back into the tuple space.
